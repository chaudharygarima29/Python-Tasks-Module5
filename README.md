# Python-Tasks-Module5
A collection of simple Python programs demonstrating Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python.

Task1 

**Write a Python program that:**

Opens a text file named sample.txt.

Reads and prints its entire content.

Displays an error message if the file does not exist.


Task2

**File Handling in Python (Write, Append, Read with User Input)**

📌 Problem Statement


Takes text input from the user and writes it into a file (sample.txt).

Takes additional input from the user and appends it as a new line in the same file.

Finally, reads the file line by line and prints the contents on the screen.

📝  Explanation

"w" mode → Creates the file (if not present) and writes new content (overwrites old data).

"a" mode → Opens the file and appends new content at the end.

"r" mode → Reads the file line by line.

The program uses input() so the user decides what gets written or appended.
